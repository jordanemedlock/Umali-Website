<h2 id="june_3">Dear Umali Friends,</h2>
<p>Greetings from Tanzania.  We have some good developments to share with you.</p>

<p>First let us tell you quickly about our day in Nairobi, May 28, during which we met with four individuals as planned. The first was Trixie Pujol, to whom Dona introduced us three years ago in Santa Fe shortly after she (Trixie) had moved to Nairobi as a VSO volunteer to spread awareness of ASD by founding Autism Awareness Kenya (AAK), eventually settling in the community ,and networking with many programs and individuals committed to the same cause. We quickly learned that Kenya is several years ahead of Tanzania both in awareness and infrastructure to support the work we also plan. Trixie chose three respected professionals to introduce us to and we were impressed with the wisdom and commitment of all of them.</p>

<p>The first was Karolien Tutts, an engaging and attractive professional who is married to a UN official, who has long experience in the community. She founded SEP Kenya (Special Education Professionals Kenya) in 1990, an organization which brings teachers and occupational therapists together to work with children on the Spectrum. Our time with each of these busy professionals was short and we expressed our desire to return to Nairobi a few days before we fly back to NY and spend more time with each.</p>

  The second was John Onaya, a Psychologist whom Trixie described as brilliant and respected by everyone in in the ASD community. We found him to be a warm and kind individual. I especially liked his response when I asked him the subject of the PhD thesis he has just completed at Kenyatta University. He told me that in his work in Nairobi with children on the Spectrum, he noticed that most of the teachers and professionals working with the families ignored the experience and information that a mother could provide about her child. His dissertation focuses on this issue and how to work better with families. Here are Trixie and John when we left Gertrude’s Children’s Hospital where both SEP and Dr. Sidney Nesbitt have offices. Here are Trixie and John with two familiar faces.

  Sid Nesbitt is the kind of Pediatrican you want to find for children on the Spectrum. He was mentioned to us by Cate McClain as a possible contact before we left and we discovered when we arrived that both Trixie and John Onaya work closely with him. I had emailed him ahead of time about the work Cate and Jane McGrath and Pat Osbourn have been doing in India via Telehealth and he responded immediately that he was very interested in participating in such a project. He already has a Teleheath relationship with Children’s Hospital in Washington DC and has approached Johns Hopkins. His focus is b the spectrum of childhood Developmental Disorders and includes ASD. He is supporting research to convert the ADOS and MCHAT into a tool that would be culturally resonant in East Africa.

  Our long drive from Nairobi brought us here on Tuesday May 29. Since then our time has been taken up with family business, but we have quickly been reminded of our purpose here by the appearance of unexpected people in our lives.

  As soon as we arrived, we were visited by a lovely Pediatrician from Puerto Rico, Maria Carrascal, her husband Omar Burgos, a Psychologist, and her son Jesse who is 17. Jesse was low on the Spectrum and it is impressive how much success she has had with him, employing  a variety of alternative medicine approaches she has studied at various institutes. Like Sid, Maria works with a variety of Developmental Disorders with emphasis on ASD. It is a shame in a way we had to leave for Dar es Salaam so quickly, but we managed three or four long and informative conversations with her. Maria is an intelligent and vivacious woman who is eager to share what she has learned from raising her son (apparently alone with his older brother). While with us, she gave us suggestions to help a neighbor child of ours with CP and help us cure (yes) Mathias’s mother of a very painful and dispiriting case of shingles by applying slices of aloe vera we chilled first in our freezer and then accompanied with remedies she gave us (same brand I have used successfully for jet lag.)

  Here is Mwanamvua and her devoted caretaker Mariam, who wept and left the room to hide her tears when I told her how clearly we could see how much she cared for the little girl. Mwanamvua (girl who brings rain) is 8 years old.  Her grandmother brought her to us while we were on a morning walk two years ago and we try to keep in touch to see what we can do for her and her family.
