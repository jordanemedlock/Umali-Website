    <h2 id="history">A Personal Umali History for Our Son, May 2013</h2>
    <p>How your story began the journey of Umali Autism Foundation Tanzania. </p>
    <p>Every program about Autism has begun at some point in time with a child whose parents sought help. That journey grows to include caretakers and service providers who want to help him or her. It is repeated many times in many places. Now the story of UAFT is becoming a community of people in Tanzania, East Africa, and the U.S., working together to help children like you. </p>
    <p>Your story is the story of every child with Autism. Some children live in countries in Africa and Asia that have more poverty and disadvantages than other parts of the world. Their parents have the same dreams and hopes for their child as all parents. In Tanzania, a country with much poverty and disease, so many children with Autism remain literally hidden away, unable even to attend school. Yet some brave and hopeful parents have already begun to create programs for children of their own. They begin with whatever they have, but reach out to their village and community. We believe if all of us work together, we will accomplish the most that is possible for children like you. </p>
    <p>For me, your story began the day I met you in Dar es Salaam when Daddy picked you up. Sadly for you, your parents, like too many parents of children with disability, had broken apart two years before. The four of us gathered at Daddy's sister Dr. Theodora Bali's's house.  At that time, Theodora was Assistant Dean of Students at the University of Dar es Salaam. Your father was happy because we were taking you back to the school in Arusha where we both worked and where he was Principal. He hoped he would be able to find someone to teach you. Because you did not speak, schools would not accept you.  It was obvious from your smiling photo, you were happy to be with your father again. </p>
    <p>You were a beautiful little boy, independent, energetic, aware, intelligent and hyperactive. You were five years old and you could not speak. You kept your little yellow car with you everywhere and would run it up and down on any surface. You still do this today when you feel bored, or restless, need self-soothing, or just need structure. Even though you can talk now and have begun catching up in school, there are and may always be residuals of Autism because Autism, we learned, is about differences in brain development and function which affect learning styles and inhibit interpersonal communication.  But even four years ago, you smiled at people you knew and looked them in the eye. Perhaps because I was with your father you accepted me and we became close very quickly. I was with you for parts of every day in Arusha when you weren't attending preschool classes at Arusha Modern. You showed us when you came home that  you were beginning to understand numbers and could sound out three letter words. Your father was excited to hope that you might eventually learn to read. Still, we were sad you had no playmates. Just your little yellow car.</p>
    <p>When we returned to Arusha, I took you to the Arusha Mental Health Center, where I had given a lecture on Dissociative Disorders a month before. We knew the psychologist there, Dr. Sheila, who was an Irish nun and had been a missionary in Tanzania for many years. She agreed to meet you and observed you playing for a quarter of an hour while we talked. She confirmed my suspicion that you appeared to have traits of Autism (repetitive movements, lack of verbal speech appropriate for your age, lack of appropriate social interaction); a further evaluation would be appropriate.  I asked her where we could find a speech therapist for you. We felt the fact you were unable to communicate verbally was the primary reason no school had accepted you. We believed that your ability to understand and use language would be the key to your further education and development. The closest speech therapist was in Nairobi; that discovery was discouraging. </p>
    <p>Frustrated about the prospects for your future, your father began to talk about resigning from Arusha Modern and starting a school for children like you. Then you and they would have opportunities to learn and grow. From the beginning, he wanted to create an inclusive school, utilizing the International Cambridge Curriculum he was trained in. Having taught Mathematics and Physics at Dar Independent School for 12 years, served as its Secondary School Assistant Head Teacher, and now Principal of a large boarding school for Primary and Secondary students at Arusha Modern School, he felt ready to draw on his years of academic and administrative experience and the network of educators in Dar and Arusha that he had been working with for over a decade. Nevertheless, given the lack of understanding of Autism in Tanzania - even the concept itself is absent or misunderstood here - the thought was daunting. Even in the largest cities of Dar es Salaam or Dodoma we did not know of speech therapists. And these are the cities that are home to the two largest Universities in Tanzania. Neither one trains speech therapists. Three years later we learned that Makarere University in Kampala Uganda, your Daddy's Alma Mater, had graduated the first class of speech therapists for East Africa. </p>
    <p>I knew that back in the U.S., where I lived before now, there were many resources for Autism. But how would we access those resources from Tanzania? Where would we start from? With years in the Mental Health field, a Doctorate in Education and a specialty in  Administration and Planning, I was ready to draw on my experience to teach and consult in Tanzania. I had committed to live and work with your father in Tanzania . Our focus was here. Then just two months after I met you, Fate intervened, unexpectedly changing the course of our immediate lives. </p>
    <p>At the end of 2009, I developed a critical illness and returned to the U.S. for treatment. Your father followed me there two months later and discovered two things that altered none of our goals but our planning on how to achieve them: 1) I was not strong enough to plan a return to Tanzania for many months and 2) the University of New Mexico Department of Pediatrics had developed a remarkable program providing many services for children and families with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  This is the Center for Development and Disability. Included among CDD's programs is one (LEND) that re-trained multidisciplinary professionals to be leaders in the field of Special Needs. </p>
    <p>Your Daddy and I entered the program in 2010. We took the opportunity to bring you to the U.S. for the services that were unavailable in Tanzania while we trained ourselves in ASD. In 2010 your father began a Masters in Special Education at UNM which he completed in 2012.  He was now teaching Special Education Mathematics at a local High School. In 2010, we began organizing a group of experienced professionals we met at CDD to found a nonprofit to raise funds and help provide services in Tanzania. Many will be coming to Tanzania to work with us. This effort has become Umali  Autism Foundation Tanzania and was granted 501c3 status by the end of 2012. In 2011, we were able to bring you and your older brother to the U.S. to live with us and attend school in the U.S. </p>
    <p>You were evaluated for ASD at the CDD and began speech therapy right away. By 2012 you were in a special class for children with ASD, but because you were “high on the spectrum,” you had inclusion classes quickly. Now you are nine years old. You can talk to us and you are catching up in  school.    </p>
    <p>We want all children in Tanzania and East Africa to have the same opportunities you have now.           </p>
    <p>Love from Mom and Dad</p>
