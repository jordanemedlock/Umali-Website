<h2 id="planning_14">Planning Our 2014 Tanzania Trainings</h2>
<p>We are so excited to be planning for our upcoming trip to Tanzania.  This year, we are raising funds for the trainings and workshops that UAFT will be providing about Autism Spectrum Disorders in Tanzania.  A very experienced team of professionals: a physician, two educators, and a speech-language pathologist are collaborating with professionals in Tanzania to develop resources for children with autism.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks and months, we will be posting updates on the goals, funds raised, events, and the planning needed to make this trip possible.  We will post new information as it becomes available.  Once we are in Tanzania, a member of our team will take many pictures to share and keep you updated about our experiences there.</p>

<p>We are currently planning a fund raiser for the afternoon of April 27th, so save the date.  UAFT will be hosting an ice cream social to welcome spring and help raise money for our upcoming workshops in Tanzania. Your contribution can help provide teaching and intervention materials, toys for kids with disabilities, and defer some of the travel costs for the team of professionals that will be providing the training.  Hopefully, we will have the troop of African dancers that we had at our last event.  Those of you who were there, know how talented these young dancers are.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming to our site, check back for regular updates on our progress.</p>
